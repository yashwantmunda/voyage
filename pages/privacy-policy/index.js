					<p>Voyage Mobile, Inc. (“Voyage Mobile,” “we,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you when you visit www.voyagetext.com or use our applications, products, and services, including our communication tools (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy also describes how we use the information we collect, with whom we share it, how we protect it, and the choices we offer you regarding our collection and use of such information.</p>

					<p>Voyage Mobile provides its customers (“Voyage Customers”) with a platform to allow those Voyage Customers to engage with individual consumers (“Consumers”) via the Services.</p>

					<p><span className="lead">1. Information We Collect.</span> We may collect personal information about you, meaning information that can uniquely identify you, from various sources, such as:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><span>Directly from our users, both Voyage Customers and Consumers. From our Voyage Customers, we collect account registration information, such as email address, name, and physical address as well as a username and password. From Consumers, we collect the information that is directly provided through our Services, including message history, consents, and any information you send through the Services. We also collect information when you communicate directly to us and our support teams;</span></li>

						<li><span>From our Voyage Customers, who provide us with contact information about their Consumers so that we can facilitate contact through the Services. All Voyage Customers are responsible for providing notice and obtaining appropriate consents necessary for us to process this information;</span></li>

						<li><span>Social networks through which you may access the Services or otherwise interact with us; and</span></li>

						<li><span>Our affiliates, service providers, business partners, and other third parties.</span></li>
					</ul>

					<p>The personal information we may collect about you may include, without limitation:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Contact information, such as name, physical address, email address, and phone number;</li>

						<li>Login information, such as username and password; and</li>

						<li>Payment and financial details, such as payment card number, expiration date, billing address, and bank account number.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>When you use the Services or the websites of our Voyage Customers that have integrated our Services, we may also collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. We may also use third-party analytics tools that collect information about use of the Services and user traffic. The information we may collect by automated means may include, without limitation:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><span>Information about the devices you use to access the Services (such as the IP address, which may identify your general geographic location, and the type of the device, operating system, and web browser);</span></li>

						<li><span>Dates, times, and duration of use of the Services (including whether you are a repeat or first time visitor); and</span></li>

						<li><span>Information on actions taken when using the Services (such as page views and website navigation patterns).</span></li>
					</ul>

					<p>The information we collect automatically is statistical data and does not include personal information. To the extent that we associate this statistical data with your personal information, we will treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

					<p><span className="lead">2. How We Respond To Do Not Track Signals.</span> Your web browser may let you choose your preference as to whether you want to allow the collection of information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services. At this time, the Services do not respond to the preferences you may have set in your web browser regarding such collection of your information, and the Services may continue to collect information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

					<p><span className="lead">3. Third-Party Use Of Cookies.</span> Some content or applications available through the Services, including advertisements, may be served by third parties. These third parties may use cookies to collect information about you when you use the Services, such as your IP address, pages you visit, and when you view a page or open an email in which a tag is embedded. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content and for other purposes. We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. The information practices of these third parties are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.</p>

					<p><span className="lead">4. How We Use The Information We Collect. </span>We may use information we obtain about you to:</p>

						<li><span>Comply with applicable legal requirements and industry standards. We also may use the information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.</span></li>
					</ul>

					<p>We also reserve the right to transfer your personal information to a buyer or other transferee in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, sale, or other transfer of some or all of our assets. Should such a sale, merger, or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy.</p>

					<p><span className="lead">6. Data Security.</span> We have implemented measures intended to protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. Please note that the electronic transmission of information is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard personal information will never be defeated or fail, or that such measures will always be sufficient or effective. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.</p>

					<p><span className="lead">7. Your Choices.</span> We offer you the following choices about the information we collect from you and how we communicate with you:</p>

					<p><span className="span-lead">Cookies.</span> Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the features of the Services.</p>
